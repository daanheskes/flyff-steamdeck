## v1.65.0 (2026-06-11)

### Features
- **Guide Monsters:** Reworked the monster guide into a multi-column layout that reads left-to-right by level instead of filling one column top-to-bottom first
- **Guide Monsters:** Added local element icon assets plus weak/strong matchup indicators directly inside each monster entry
- **Guide Monsters:** Added Flyff API monster portraits in the guide for monsters that expose an API icon filename

### Bug Fixes
- **Input:** Fixed "stuck" modifier keys (Alt, Control, etc.) after Alt+Tab or window focus loss
- **Input:** Unblocked the comma (`,`) key; it can now be used for typing in-game while still functioning as a macro trigger
- **Macros:** Macro sequences now accept comma as an actual key and support modifier combinations like `Ctrl+1`, `Alt+1`, and `Control+F2`
- **Guide Monsters:** Weak-to and strong-against are now derived from Flyff API resistance values instead of a simplified hard-coded guess
- **Guide Monsters:** Cached monster fallback data is normalized into the same richer guide format as live API data

### Features
- Initial monster guide rework and build script improvements.

## v1.63.0 (2026-05-28)

### Features
- **Follow + Board:** Added configurable follow/board button bindings in Settings instead of hard-wiring `Z` and `Alt+6`
- **Guide Monsters:** The monster guide now loads the full Flyff monster list from the official API and caches it locally as fallback

### Bug Fixes
- **Macros:** Fixed comma input in macro key sequences by suspending global shortcuts while the Settings window is focused
- **Guide Monsters:** Corrected monster levels by using API `level` data instead of the old simplified bundled list

### Features
- **Macros:** Expanded fullbuff sequence to include '0' key and F1 (full sequence: F2, 1-9, 0, F1)

### Bug Fixes
- **Gamepad:** Fixed configuration loading to properly merge bundled defaults with user settings — buttons are now pre-configured on first launch
- **Settings:** Disabled sandbox mode to fix dropdown menu flickering on Wayland/SteamOS

### Changes

- All timing configs maintain backward compatibility with old ms-based values
